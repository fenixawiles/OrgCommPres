    <h1>Faculty & Research Impact</h1>
    <p>How the Integration Strengthens Research, Collaboration, and Academic Careers</p>
</header>

<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>A Unified Research Enterprise</h2>
    <p>
        Prior to the integration, UT Health San Antonio and UTSA were already major research institutions.
        UT Health San Antonio employed roughly <strong>8,700 faculty and staff</strong>, including about 
        <strong>4,000 faculty members</strong> and <strong>1,400 healthcare providers</strong>, and generated 
        <strong>$413 million</strong> in sponsored program awards annually. UTSA contributed an additional 
        <strong>7,000 employees</strong> and <strong>$152 million</strong> in annual R&D expenditures.
    </p>

    <p>
        Post-merger, UT San Antonio reports a combined workforce of approximately 
        <strong>17,000 faculty and staff</strong> and more than <strong>$486 million</strong> in annual research funding, 
        along with over <strong>500 active clinical trials</strong>. This level of scale places the unified institution 
        among the largest and most research-intensive academic enterprises in Texas.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 2 -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Enhanced Interdisciplinary Collaboration</h2>
    <p>
        The UT System Integration FAQ highlights that the merger is designed to 
        <strong>“foster more seamless collaboration among faculty in teaching, research, healthcare and service 
        to facilitate maximum success in the classroom, lab and across the continuum of patient care.”</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Faculty now have greater access to cross-disciplinary teams linking:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Health sciences and biomedical research</li>
        <li>Engineering and applied sciences</li>
        <li>Data science, AI, and machine learning</li>
        <li>Clinical medicine and translational research</li>
        <li>Public health, population science, and community outreach</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These structural changes increase competitiveness for major federal grants and 
        support deeper collaborations with industry, government agencies, and military partners.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 3 -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Strengthened Research Competitiveness</h2>
    <p>
        The integration deck and UT Health San Antonio reports highlight several major research strengths 
        that position the merged institution as a national competitor:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Five NIH-funded centers within UT Health San Antonio</li>
        <li>A <strong>top 3% global ranking</strong> for NIH funding</li>
        <li>A <strong>top 2% global ranking</strong> in clinical medicine specialties</li>
        <li>UTSA’s federal-scale research assets, including:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CyManII</strong>, a $120 million DOE Cybersecure Manufacturing Institute</li>
            <li>An NSF-funded National Hub for Neuromorphic Computing</li>
        </ul>
        <li>R1 (very high research activity) designation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The merger connects these strengths, creating aligned research clusters instead of isolated silos 
        and enabling Texas to compete for larger, more complex scientific initiatives.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 4 -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>New Research Facilities and Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>
        Faculty benefit directly from major new research and clinical infrastructure built around the merger. 
        These investments expand the university’s capacity to conduct high-impact science and attract 
        research-active faculty.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Science One</strong> — a $100 million facility supporting cancer, dementia, aging, and diabetes research</li>
        <li><strong>NeuroRecovery Research Lab</strong> — advancing spinal cord injury rehabilitation science</li>
        <li><strong>UT Health San Antonio Multispecialty & Research Hospital</strong> — a $471 million clinical and research facility</li>
        <li><strong>Center for Global and Community Oral Health</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Center for Regenerative Sciences</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These facilities create new opportunities for grant acquisition, lab expansion, 
        translational research, and interdisciplinary innovation.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 5 -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Faculty Roles, Governance, and Mission Alignment</h2>
    <p>
        UT System leadership emphasizes that the merger strengthens faculty governance and philanthropic 
        alignment by presenting donors with unified initiatives rather than competing ones. 
        Faculty are supported within a single, mission-driven institution that integrates health, 
        research, teaching, commercialization, and public service.
    </p>

    <p>
        The new mission statement approved by the Regents reinforces this direction, emphasizing excellence in:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Education</li>
        <li>Research, discovery, and commercialization</li>
        <li>Health and clinical service</li>
        <li>Public service</li>
        <li>Community engagement</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These institutional priorities expand faculty influence beyond traditional academic work, 
        strengthening roles in statewide health service, innovation, and economic development.
    </p>
