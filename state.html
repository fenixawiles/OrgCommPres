    <h1>State Impact</h1>
    <p>How the UTSA–UT Health San Antonio Merger Reshapes Higher Education and Healthcare Across Texas</p>
</header>

<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>A Strategic Statewide Integration</h2>
    <p>
        The UT System Board of Regents describes the UTSA–UT Health San Antonio merger as the creation 
        of “a premier global university to best serve Texas and the nation,” emphasizing increased 
        public impact, global competitiveness, and statewide benefit. The merger is not simply an 
        administrative consolidation—it is the unification of two Carnegie R1 institutions into a 
        single, large-scale research university capable of advancing Texas’s standing in national 
        research, healthcare delivery, and scientific innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
        With more than <strong>$486 million in annual research expenditures</strong>, the unified institution 
        becomes the <strong>third-largest public research university in Texas</strong>, trailing only UT Austin 
        and Texas A&M. This scale gives Texas a stronger position in federal research funding, large 
        multi-institutional grants, and high-impact scientific collaborations.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 2 -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Expanded Research Capacity Across Texas</h2>
    <p>
        The merged university operates across <strong>15 colleges and schools</strong>, <strong>six campuses</strong>, and more 
        than <strong>320 degree and certificate programs</strong>. Official UT System materials highlight that this 
        expanded structure enables Texas to conduct integrated, cross-disciplinary research at levels 
        previously not possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        The integration allows Texas to host large-scale, coordinated projects across:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Basic biomedical sciences</li>
        <li>Clinical trials and translational medicine</li>
        <li>Engineering and biomedical engineering</li>
        <li>Artificial intelligence and machine learning</li>
        <li>Cybersecurity and data science</li>
        <li>Public health and population sciences</li>
        <li>Social and behavioral sciences</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        According to UT Health San Antonio’s Mission Magazine, the integration leverages 
        <strong>six federally funded R&D centers</strong> and a research enterprise approaching 
        <strong>$470 million annually</strong>, elevating Texas’s profile in health and scientific innovation.
    </p>

<!-- SECTION 3 -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Strengthening Texas’s Healthcare Workforce</h2>
    <p>
        UT San Antonio now trains a substantial share of the state’s nurses, physicians, dentists, 
        and allied health professionals. The institution manages more than <strong>500 clinical trials</strong> 
        and supports a comprehensive health network that provides <strong>over 2.5 million patient visits 
        annually</strong> across South Texas.
    </p>

    <p>
        Combined with the fact that <strong>over 90% of UTSA graduates remain in the Texas workforce</strong>, 
        the unified institution is a major lever for addressing statewide shortages in:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Primary care and rural health</li>
        <li>Nursing and nurse anesthesia</li>
        <li>Public health and epidemiology</li>
        <li>Biomedical engineering</li>
        <li>AI-enabled medical diagnostics</li>
        <li>Dental and oral health professions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This makes the merger a central component of Texas’s long-term workforce development strategy.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 4 -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>A Mission Aligned With Statewide Priorities</h2>
    <p>
        The newly approved mission statement for the unified university emphasizes statewide 
        obligations: “to make lives better by advancing excellence in education; research, 
        discovery and commercialization; health; public service; and community engagement.” 
        This language, reaffirmed by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on 
        Colleges (SACSCOC), reflects a mandate to serve all of Texas—not only San Antonio.
    </p>
    <p>
        The San Antonio Report highlighted this shift, noting that the merged university’s roles 
        extend beyond traditional campus boundaries into broad statewide research, clinical, and 
        economic missions.
    </p>

<!-- SECTION 5 -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Impact on South Texas: A Critical Regional Priority</h2>
    <p>
        The UT System’s Integration FAQ positions San Antonio as “the gateway to South Texas,” 
        a region of approximately <strong>5.5 million residents</strong>—projected to grow to 
        <strong>6.1 million by 2040</strong>. Much of this population is historically underserved and 
        medically vulnerable.
    </p>

    <p>
        The merger is explicitly designed to scale:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Educational access across a multi-county region</li>
        <li>Healthcare delivery and clinical expansion</li>
        <li>Biomedical and translational research capacity</li>
        <li>Workforce pipelines into high-need medical and STEM fields</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This means the integration is not just an institutional realignment—it is a statewide 
        infrastructure commitment to advancing the health, education, and economic stability 
        of South Texas.
    </p>
