    <h1>Student Impact</h1>
    <p>How the UTSA & UT Health San Antonio Merger Expands Opportunities for Students</p>
</header>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Expanded Academic Pathways</h2>
    <p>
        The integration between UTSA and UT Health San Antonio significantly expands academic mobility 
        for students pursuing careers in health, biomedical research, engineering, AI, public health, 
        and clinical professions. According to the UT System Integration FAQ, the unified institution 
        will create “a clear pathway from undergraduate to graduate programs for UTSA students, 
        especially in the health sciences.” This means students can transition more easily into advanced 
        medical and research training without needing to relocate or navigate two separate university systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        These aligned pathways allow earlier exposure to graduate-level coursework, clinical environments, 
        laboratories, and interdisciplinary research spaces—particularly valuable for students entering fields 
        where early specialization improves long-term success.
    </p>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Expanded Joint and Pipeline Degree Programs</h2>
    <p>
        Prior to the merger, UTSA and UT Health San Antonio already collaborated on multiple joint academic programs. 
        The merger strengthens them and accelerates the development of new bridges between undergraduate and 
        professional education. Official system documents and UTSA’s integration presentations list the following 
        established or expanded programs:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Joint School of Public Health:</strong> MPH and DrPH programs</li>
        <li><strong>Biomedical Engineering PhD</strong> (UTSA + UT Health joint program)</li>
        <li><strong>MD/MS in Artificial Intelligence</strong> — the first dual degree of its kind in the U.S.</li>
        <li><strong>3+2 accelerated programs</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>Respiratory Care</li>
                <li>Medical Laboratory Science</li>
                <li>Physical Therapy</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>2+2 Nursing pathway</strong> enabling faster completion of a BSN</li>
        <li><strong>PhD in Translational Science</strong> (joint multi-institution program)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These programs deepen undergraduate access to graduate-level training, reduce time to degree completion, 
        and support the development of highly skilled health and STEM professionals in Texas.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>AI, Medicine, and Innovation Pathways</h2>
    <p>
        A major student-facing outcome of the integration is the nationally recognized 
        <strong>MD/MS in Artificial Intelligence</strong> program. Highlighted by UT Health San Antonio, this 
        dual-degree pathway prepares future physicians to lead in AI-driven diagnostics, medical imaging, 
        predictive analytics, and machine learning applications in healthcare.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additional merger-aligned programs—such as the <strong>Nurse Anesthesia DNP</strong> and the 
        <strong>Dental Hygiene degree in Laredo</strong>—were developed to meet workforce shortages across 
        the 38–60 counties served by the university and its health network. These programs combine 
        advanced clinical instruction with high-impact research training.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Benefits for a Diverse Student Population</h2>
    <p>
        UTSA is a nationally recognized leader in social mobility and is designated both an R1 research university 
        and a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI). With 58 percent of its students identifying as Hispanic or Latino, 
        the merger opens the door for historically underserved students in South Texas to access 
        high-end clinical, biomedical, engineering, and AI research opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
        By connecting a large public research university with a major academic health center, the integration 
        increases access to laboratories, clinical placements, research assistantships, and advanced professional 
        pipelines that were previously available only through UT Health’s independent admissions system. 
        Students now experience a more unified academic and support pathway.
    </p>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Financial Accessibility and Support</h2>
    <p>
        While not exclusive to the merger, UT System initiatives—most notably the expansion of the 
        <strong>UT Promise Plus</strong> tuition-assistance program—interact directly with the integration’s goals. 
        These policies reduce financial barriers for low-income Texans pursuing health, biomedical, and STEM education, 
        making the newly expanded pathways more accessible to students across socioeconomic backgrounds.
