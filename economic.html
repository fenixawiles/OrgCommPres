    <h1>Economic Impact</h1>
    <p>The Financial, Research, and Workforce Effects of the UTSA–UT Health San Antonio Integration</p>
</header>

<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>A Unified 7 Billion Dollar Annual Economic Engine</h2>
    <p>
        The merged institution, now operating as The University of Texas at San Antonio, generates
        an estimated <strong>$7 billion in annual economic impact</strong> according to official UTSA and
        UT Health San Antonio communications. This figure reflects not only the combined operational
        budgets of both universities, but also the induced and indirect economic effects from hiring,
        research expenditures, local spending, and the expansion of the region’s healthcare and
        biosciences sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
        This impact makes the unified institution one of the largest economic engines in Texas
        higher education—exceeded only by major systems like Texas A&M and UT Austin.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 2 -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Pre-Merger Baselines: Two Powerful Economic Entities</h2>
    <p>
        Before integration, UTSA alone already produced <strong>$2.6 billion in annual economic output</strong>.
        With 34,000 students, 7,000 employees, $152 million in annual research expenditures, and a
        $300 million endowment, UTSA was one of the fastest-growing research universities in the country.
    </p>

    <p>
        UT Health San Antonio, simultaneously, was a central pillar of the city’s
        <strong>$44.1 billion healthcare and biosciences industry</strong>. It contributed:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>$413 million in sponsored research awards</li>
        <li>$781 million endowment</li>
        <li>4,300 students across health, medicine, and biomedical fields</li>
        <li>8,700 employees, including ~4,000 faculty and 1,400 healthcare providers</li>
        <li>2.8 million patient visits per year</li>
        <li>520+ active clinical trials</li>
        <li>Over 120 medical specialties and subspecialties</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These baselines justify why the 7-billion-dollar estimate is realistic rather than a promotional figure.
        Both institutions were already independently large-scale economic drivers.
    </p>

<!-- SECTION 3 -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Research Expenditures and National Competitiveness</h2>
    <p>
        Post-merger, UT San Antonio reports more than
        <strong>$486 million in annual research expenditures</strong>,
        making it one of the most research-intensive universities in the country. This includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Six federally funded research & development centers</li>
        <li>A top 3% worldwide NIH funding ranking for UT Health San Antonio</li>
        <li>UTSA’s R1 (“very high research activity”) designation</li>
        <li>Major cross-disciplinary initiatives in AI, neuroscience, aging, cancer, and infectious disease</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The UT System Integration FAQ emphasizes that this scale dramatically improves competitiveness
        for grants, contracts, and industry partnerships—particularly at the intersection of health sciences,
        engineering, applied sciences, and data science.
    </p>

<!-- SECTION 4 -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Capital Investments and Infrastructure Growth</h2>
    <p>
        The merged university drives long-term economic output through major capital expansions,
        including:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Science One</strong> — a $100 million research facility for cancer, dementia, aging, and diabetes</li>
        <li><strong>NeuroRecovery Research Lab</strong> — advancing spinal cord injury rehabilitation science</li>
        <li><strong>UT Health San Antonio Multispecialty & Research Hospital</strong> — a $471 million facility opened in 2024</li>
        <li>Dozens of research centers, institutes, and clinical expansion sites</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These investments stimulate construction, biotech commercialization, equipment contracting,
        and long-term job creation.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 5 -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Workforce & Economic Mobility Effects</h2>
    <p>
        UTSA is ranked as a <strong>Top 50 university for economic mobility</strong>, and more than
        <strong>90% of its alumni stay in the Texas workforce</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This means the merger’s economic effect extends beyond institutional budgets—it shapes the
        earning power, workforce supply, and long-term socioeconomic outcomes of hundreds of thousands
        of graduates over time. The integrated institution now feeds Texas with highly demanded talent in:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Medicine & clinical care</li>
        <li>Biomedical engineering</li>
        <li>AI in healthcare</li>
        <li>Public health</li>
        <li>Neuroscience & aging</li>
        <li>Biotech & life sciences</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The merger ensures these talent pipelines are more coordinated, more accessible, and better aligned
        with statewide industry needs.
    </p>
